# Producing-publication-ready-plots-with-seaborn
Python coding project from Codecademy. Uses Primarily Seaborn to generate publishable graphs.

This project originates from my project completed in the Codecademy workspace. It contains some additions to the coding tasks required in the orginal project. The dataset for this Project comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset from Kaggle.

Any future additions to this project will most likely be additional analyses and improving on existing code.
